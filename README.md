## Questions
##### you may ask

- Whats the game about?
	- The Game is about fighting, kind of a mix between the generic 1v1 fighting game and smash bros, but with a "special" touch... YOU ARE IN A BUBBLE!!!!!!

---

- Why is this game Open Source?
	- I (n4c) have a list of reasons, here it is
	- 1.- I support FOSS and like when software and games are open source and free
	- 2.- Julibros wanted Modding to go crazy, so he chose the idea of the game being open source instead of it having a Modding API
	- 3.- Because it's easier to track errors and things like that
